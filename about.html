      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a former Napier University graduate that obtained a BEng in Internet
        Computing and spent some time in the industry with bug
        fixing/support/junior developer roles. Most of my time has been spent
        working with the content management system, Drupal but I'm hoping to
        learn less specalized skills from CodeClan in a bid to find roles more
        suited to technology that's popular in Edinburgh.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've attended an Open Day, looked at the courses, then viewed the
        YouTube series Road to Code and was keen to apply to the course. It was
        also recommended to me by Skills Development Scotland since most Junior
        & Graduate level roles in Edinburgh are accessed by already being on a
        University/Collage course. All the other roles advertised on job sites
        are mostly focused on Mid to Senior level devs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've enjoyed following various YouTube series to help my coding. These
        include Traversy Media, Web Dev Simplified, Level Up Tuts, The Net
        Ninja, Derk Banas, The New Boston, Codecourse, Drupal Up, My Bring Back
        and Code Karate. I've also done some courses on Codecademy. However I
        feel the only way to become a better developer is to code with and learn
        with/from other developers which I'd be able to obtain from CodeClan
        rather than just following online tutorials. I try to keep copies of
        what I've done in my
        <a href="https://github.com/markpackham?tab=repositories"
          >Github repo</a
        >
        since it is so easy to forget stuff. I also very much enjoy attending
        the Drupal Scotland community's conventions and meetups.
